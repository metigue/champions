## Issue: Debug Code and Incorrect Battleground Scores

### Current Status:
1. Debug code cleanup: ✅ Completed
   - Removed numerous debug print statements from build_database.py

2. Battleground score fix: In progress
   - Identified root cause: Regex patterns incorrectly extracting ratings when emojis follow the number
   - Example: "Human Torch - 107ï¸â£" was extracting rating as 107 instead of 10

3. Regex fixes applied:
   - Updated patterns in both build_database.py and data_manager.py
   - Used lookahead pattern `r'^(.*?)\s*-\s*(\d+)(?=\s|$|[^\w\s-])'` to better isolate ratings

### Next Steps for Future Work:
1. The current regex fix needs refinement - testing showed some entries result in "No match"
2. Consider switching to a pure Python approach instead of regex:
   - Since the maximum rating is 10, look specifically for numbers 1-10 (or 0-10)
   - Extract the first number in the valid range after the "-" separator
   - This would be more robust against emoji characters

3. Re-run the full build process after refining the solution
4. Test end-to-end with live Google Sheets to confirm scores are now correct

### Code Files Modified:
- build_database.py: Fixed primary rating extraction pattern
- data_manager.py: Fixed both primary and alternative rating extraction patterns
- test_regex.py: Created for testing regex patterns (not part of main codebase)

The core issue was in the rating extraction logic not properly handling emoji characters that follow intended rating numbers.
