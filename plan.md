# MCOC Champions Discord Bot - Implementation Plan

## Project Overview

Create a Discord bot that provides MARVEL Contest of Champions (MCoC) players with champion recommendations, pull advice, and rank-up suggestions based on publicly accessible community-maintained tier lists from Google Sheets (scraped via web).

## Phase 1: Project Setup and Dependencies

### 1.1 Initialize Project Structure
- Create project directory structure
- Initialize Python virtual environment
- Set up requirements.txt with necessary packages
- Create configuration files for bot tokens and settings

### 1.2 Install Dependencies
- discord.py for Discord bot functionality
- requests for web scraping
- pandas for data processing
- beautifulsoup4 for HTML parsing
- python-dotenv for environment variable management
- asyncio for async operations

### 1.3 Set Up Discord Bot
- Create Discord application and bot
- Get bot token
- Set up initial bot permissions
- Test basic bot connectivity

## Phase 2: Data Access and Processing

### 2.1 Web Scraping Integration
- Access both spreadsheet sources via CSV export URLs:
  - "Vega's BGs Tierlist" (https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1KzfdzI_HxK7zk_eTwmdwI5G84k9HSIYPzAMSPgGYjUE/export?format=csv&gid=0)
  - "MCoC Illuminati Tier List" (https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/10OeQixQCrMKuw-pa3-LDUOQO70WGAFYROPu825Kr-eo/export?format=csv&gid=323504536)
- Extract champion data from both sheets
- Handle different spreadsheet formats and structures

### 2.2 Data Processing
- Parse champion names and tier rankings
- Extract special attributes and symbols
- Create unified data structure for all champion info
- Handle data updates and caching

### 2.3 Data Storage
- Design data model for champion information
- Implement caching mechanism for offline access
- Create data refresh/update system

## Phase 3: Core Bot Functionality

### 3.1 Basic Command Framework
- Set up command prefix system
- Implement !help command
- Create base command structure
- Add error handling for commands

### 3.2 Champion Lookup System
- Implement !champion <name> command
- Fuzzy matching for champion names
- Display tier, category, and special notes
- Show detailed champion information

### 3.3 Pull Recommendations
- Implement !pulls command
- Analyze tier lists to identify top-tier champions
- Filter by category if needed
- Present recommendations in user-friendly format

### 3.4 Rank Up Suggestions
- Implement !rankup command
- Identify champions worth investing resources in
- Factor in current meta and player needs
- Provide prioritized list

## Phase 4: Advanced Features

### 4.1 Category-Based Commands
- Implement commands to filter by champion type (Cosmic, Mutant, Tech, etc.)
- Add category-specific recommendations
- Cross-reference multiple data sources

### 4.2 Meta Analysis
- Compare different tier lists
- Highlight discrepancies between sources
- Show consensus picks vs. controversial rankings

### 4.3 Custom User Preferences
- Allow users to input their current champions
- Provide personalized recommendations
- Track user progress over time

## Phase 5: Bot Deployment and Monitoring

### 5.1 Deployment Setup
- Set up production environment
- Configure environment variables
- Implement logging system
- Add health checks

### 5.2 Testing
- Unit tests for data processing
- Integration tests for web scraping
- Command functionality testing
- Error handling verification

### 5.3 Monitoring and Maintenance
- Implement data refresh scheduling
- Monitor web scraping reliability
- Error logging and alerts
- Regular updates to reflect new tier lists

## Technical Architecture

### Data Flow
1. Public Google Sheets → Web Scraping → Data Processing → Cached Storage
2. Bot Commands → Data Query → Formatted Response
3. Regular Updates → Data Refresh → Cache Update

### Key Components
- `data_manager.py`: Handle web scraping and data processing
- `champion_model.py`: Define champion data structure
- `command_handler.py`: Process Discord commands
- `tier_calculator.py`: Analyze and calculate recommendations
- `bot_main.py`: Main bot application

### Error Handling Strategy
- Graceful handling of web scraping failures
- Fallback data when primary sources unavailable
- User-friendly error messages
- Logging for debugging
